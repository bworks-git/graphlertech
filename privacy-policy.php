					partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or 
					servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also

					our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>
					<p class="desc1">However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
					
					<p class="title2">Third party links</p>					
					<p class="desc1">Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our 
					website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore 
					have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, 
					we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

					<ul class="cms_lst">
						<li>Remarketing with Google AdSense</li>
						<li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="desc1">We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google 
					Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party 
					identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad 
					service functions as they relate to our website.</p>
					<p class="desc1"><b>Opting out:</b></p>

					<p class="title2">Fair Information Practices</p>					
					<p class="desc1">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
					and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection 
					laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they 
					should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal 
					information.</p>
					
					<p class="title2">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>					
					<p class="desc1">We will notify the users via email </p>
					<ul class="cms_lst">
						<li> Within 7 business days</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="desc1">We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to  
					pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the 
					law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, 
					but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or 
					prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
					
					
					<p class="title2">CAN SPAM Act</p>					
					<p class="desc1">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements 
					for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to 
					them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
